//! Host-neutral asynchronous client engine for Radroots.
//!
//! Advanced hosts compose capabilities through [`ClientBuilder`] and operate
//! through a cloneable [`Client`]. All fallible root operations use [`Result`]
//! and the SDK-owned [`Error`] boundary.
//!
//! Constructing an empty builder performs no I/O and makes missing composition
//! explicit:
//!
//! ```
//! use radroots_sdk::ClientBuilder;
//!
//! let result = ClientBuilder::new().build();
//! assert!(result.is_err());
//! ```
//!
//! Native structs are constructor-led and representation-private. Hosts must
//! not depend on field layout:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use radroots_sdk::ClientBuilder;
//!
//! let _ = ClientBuilder { storage: None };
//! ```
